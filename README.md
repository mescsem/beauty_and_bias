# Beauty and Bias: A Critical Analysis of Beauty Standards in Machine Learning

The goal of this project is to analyze what drives “attractiveness” in the popular CelebA dataset, understanding how these beauty standards are embedded within and reflected into the field of Machine Learning in general, and performing a critical analysis of results considering not only the technological but also the societal, cultural and ethical associations and implications of findings.

## Background

Since AlexNet's victory in the 2012 ImageNet challenge, convolutional neural networks and machine learning have surged in popularity, reshaping various industries. Facial recognition, a prominent application of computer vision, has become ubiquitous in our daily lives, with our devices employing this technology. However, the algorithms behind facial recognition's ability to learn and identify faces often receive less attention.

Training algorithms for facial recognition starts with extensive data, including datasets like CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA). CelebA contains over 200,000 images of 10,000 celebrities, annotated with 40 attributes. These annotations include physical characteristics, expressions, and subjective qualities like attractiveness. However, concerns arise regarding the transparency of the annotation process and the subjectivity of certain attributes.

Although CelebA is not a perfect representation of available data, it has become widely used, perpetuating biases and subjectivity in facial recognition applications. The dataset reflects beauty standards within the field of machine learning, influencing numerous projects since its introduction in 2015.


## Conclusions

In conclusion, the analysis of CelebA highlights several concerning issues that demand attention and action. The dataset's lack of diversity and underrepresentation is problematic, considering its extensive use in facial recognition and computer vision tasks. The following points further illustrate the implications and risks associated with these issues:

1. **Exclusion and Bias**: CelebA underrepresents or outright excludes large segments of the population, perpetuating societal biases. For instance, the dataset's narrow representation of certain beauty standards prioritizes a Eurocentric and feminine ideal, leading to discrimination against individuals who do not conform to these standards. Moreover, the lack of racial and ethnic diversity reinforces exclusionary practices and contributes to further discrimination and marginalization.

2. **Unrealistic Beauty Standards**: Unrealistic beauty standards depicted in CelebA can contribute to body shaming, unrealistic expectations, and even physical or mental health issues for individuals who do not fit these narrow definitions. Such standards can have detrimental effects on self-esteem and well-being, particularly for vulnerable populations.

3. **Incorrect Labels**: CelebA contains objectively incorrect labels, even for features that should leave no room for subjectivity, such as wearing glasses. This undermines the dataset's reliability and raises concerns about the accuracy of models trained on it. Researchers and developers relying on CelebA often trust the labels without the possibility of manually inspecting the vast number of annotations, which exceeds millions.

4. **Discriminatory Consequences**: Algorithms trained on biased datasets like CelebA can perpetuate and amplify harmful societal stereotypes. The biases present in the dataset can result in discriminatory practices, particularly in domains like law enforcement and surveillance, where facial recognition technology is employed. This raises serious concerns about the fair treatment of individuals from underrepresented groups and the potential for the technology to exacerbate existing inequalities.

5. **Unintended Consequences**: The unintended consequences of using biased datasets and developing technology without addressing these biases can have far-reaching effects. The deployment of facial recognition systems trained on datasets like CelebA can lead to the misidentification or exclusion of individuals from underrepresented groups, causing harm and reinforcing systemic inequalities.

To address these issues, it is essential to recognize and challenge biases in dataset collection, labeling, and usage. Efforts should focus on promoting diversity, inclusivity, and cultural sensitivity in data collection practices. Ethical considerations must be at the forefront of algorithm development to ensure fair and equitable outcomes for all individuals, regardless of their race, gender, age, or other defining characteristics. Additionally, critical analysis and ongoing scrutiny of datasets and algorithms are vital to identify and rectify biases, striving for less biased and more objectively fair datasets and models.

As a society, it is our responsibility to prioritize the development and utilization of technology that respects human rights, fosters inclusivity, and addresses systemic biases. Only through concerted efforts can we work towards more equitable datasets, algorithms, and systems that uphold the principles of fairness and justice for all.
